Simple PHP File Manager
===================

A very simple PHP file manager.  All the code is contained in a single php file.   

## What's different in this fork?

- Delete Confirmation 
- Files to hide are configurable

## Key Features

- Single file, there are no images, or css folders
- Ajax based so it is fast, but doesn't break the back button
- Allows drag and drop file uploads if folder is writable by the webserver
- Simple and minimalistic UI.  More like Dropbox, and less like Windows Explorer
- Works with Unicode file names
- The interface is usable from an iPad
- XSRF protection (though no authentication system)

## Getting Started 
Copy `index.php` to a folder on your web server.
